    <h2>Empowering Women, Strengthening Communities</h2>
    <p>
        At Grace Foundation, we believe that empowering women is essential for building resilient communities. In Miyare village, we are proud to support women’s economic empowerment through our pilot program, providing business loans to widows.
    </p>
    <p>
        So far, 10 widows have received loans of Ksh 8,000 each, helping them grow their businesses and improve their family’s livelihoods. This initiative is a vital step towards financial independence and economic stability for these women.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through these efforts, we are not only supporting individual families but also fostering the growth of the local economy, creating a lasting impact in the community.
