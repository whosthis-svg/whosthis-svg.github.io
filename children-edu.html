    <h2>Empowering Through Education</h2>
    <p>
        Our education support focuses on providing scholarships to children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Since our inception, we have successfully supported up to 20 students at both primary and secondary school levels.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to scholarships, we also distribute hygiene kits and shoes to schools in need, directly impacting the well-being of students in underprivileged communities.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our vision for the future is ambitious: We aim to provide educational opportunities to over 100 students annually in the next five years, empowering young minds for a brighter future.
